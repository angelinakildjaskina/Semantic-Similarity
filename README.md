# Semantic-Similarity
This program reads from a text file containing movies and their descriptions. It uses the SpaCy module and returns which movie has the most similar description to the reference movie (*Planet Hulk*).

## How to Install the Program
* Download this repository as a .zip file
* Unzip the downloaded materials
* Open a IDE (for example, Visual Studio Code) and open the **watch_next.py** file through it
  * You can drag and drop the file from the downloaded folder
* Done! You can now run the program
  * Always ensure that the **movies.txt** file is in the same directory as **watch_next.py**
  
## How to use the program?
* When you run the program, it prints one of the movies from the movies.txt
* If you wish to add more movies to the text file and run the program again, ensure that the added movie has the same formatting as the other ones
* You can also change the reference movie, for this you must reassign the reference variable
  * **reference** is a variable that stores the description
  * make sure to change the last print statement in case you decide to change the reference movie
